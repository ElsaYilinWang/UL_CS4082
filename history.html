            <h4>I. Introduction: The Nature and Consequences of the Crusades</h4>
            <p>Spanning more than two centuries (1096-1300 CE) across the majority of the so-called High Middle Ages, the Crusades were, 
                in essence, military expeditions initiated by the medieval papacy to wrest the Holy Lands from Moslem control. 
                That means, if they can be traced back to a single source, 
                it's fair to say it was the Christian Church in the West. 
                Yet, the promotion of warfare was clearly not at the top of the Vatican's agenda prior to the eleventh century and so it's also fair to ask how such a dramatic shift in policy came to be, 
                that popes moved from denouncing bloodshed to demanding it in the name of God.

            <h4>II. The First Crusade (1096-1099 CE)</h4>
            <h6>A. The Causes and Excuses of the First Crusade</h6>
            <p>
                The spark that set off the Crusades was struck not in Europe but the East, when the Byzantines first confronted a new Moslem force, the Seljuk Turks (see Section 14). 
                Originally an Asian horde which, like the Huns of earlier times, had penetrated far into the West,
                 the Seljuk Turks controlled much of the Near East by the eleventh century CE. 
                 With Persia in their grip—including Baghdad, the capital of the Moslem world—they had converted to Islam en masse and presented a truly terrifying prospect: "Moslem Huns," or Mongol jihaders. 
                 The Byzantines were right to be concerned.
                <br>
                Worry quickly turned to panic when Turkish forces began expanding into eastern Asia Minor. 
                Meeting the Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 CE, 
                the Byzantines were badly defeated and stood on the verge of losing the whole of Asia Minor to Turkish onslaught. 
                Casting about for help and seeing none nearby, 
                they resorted to what must have seemed to them a last resort, 
                appealing to the West for aid.

            <h6>B. The Call for a Crusade</h6>
            <p>
                That was chum no school of cardinals could resist. Pope Urban II warmly embraced the idea of helping Europe's "beleaguered allies" and fellow Christians in the East, so he proposed a holy war—a radical shift in Christian doctrine, to say the least—and explained this maneuver not as any substantive change of direction but as an extension of a policy already in place entitled the Truce of God. This program of measures was part of the Church's attempt to limit warfare within Europe in the day by insisting there be no fighting on holidays or weekends
            </p>
            <h6>C. The History of the First Crusade</h6>
            <p>
                The First Crusade began in 1096 CE, when Christian knights began to assemble from all over Europe and move toward Constantinople. The Byzantines were horrified to see hordes of Western Europeans knocking at their doors, particularly because most of the crusaders were poor and, worse still, poorly armed. When he had made his initial request, Alexius Comnenus was not asking the Pope for mobs of indigent desperadoes but a small force of skilled fighters who could help him repulse the Turks. To the Byzantines, this multitude was no army but a different sort of invasion.
